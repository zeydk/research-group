**Twittersphere** is an independent multidisciplinary research circle, performing computational social research. We incorporate socially meaningful and theoretically informed research into cutting-edge computational tools to address various critical social problems, including migration, education, public health, and far-right extremism.

Our research team consisting of social researchers and computational experts utilizes **big data** to understand public attitudes, social disparities and behaviors. We conduct social media research to analyze trends and temporalities in our foci of interest.
